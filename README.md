# Recovery-Radar

## Description

https://newguyengithub.github.io/Recovery-Radar/ is a quick search tool based off Google's Places API that allows users to quickly find medical professionals and institutions in a set area for set medical fields or types of service. We will provide users with a limited set of input values to ensure search options are limited to those in the medical field and services provided. Using Google Places API, we will start with the main function and focus being on finding basic information such as Name of professional and/or office, location, and contact info. As we get further in and if we feel the need, we will flesh out returned info more.
We plan to supplement this with another API from a group like Yelp where we can let users see reviews or additional information from another source about the location they are inquiring about.
